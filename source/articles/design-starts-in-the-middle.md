I've been working with Made Tech as a user-centred principal for the past year. Part of my role is working with central government clients to shape work. 

## How we do design
Made Tech does user-centred design. This means we follow a process to ensure that the products and services we create are accessible, solve real (not imagined) problems and deliver solutions that work. We do this by following the GDS [phases of agile delivery](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery):

1. **Discovery**: what's the problem?
2. **Alpha**: what's the solution?
3. **Beta**: build the solution
4. **Live**: improve the solution

The goal is to continually reduce the risk of solving the wrong problem and delivering the wrong solution throughout the project's lifecycle.

We design this way to ensure public money is spent prudently. Citizens don't get a choice in the services they use (for example, applying for a passport or reporting their taxes), so we must ensure the quality of experience.

Of course, the process can also be applied outside of the public sector. I'd argue it's always beneficial to design products and services this way as it ensures commercial success and reduces delivery risk.

My colleague, Joanne Moore, talks in greater depth about what happens at each phase in her video "[How to set up user-centred design to save time and money](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQouDEL7ubA)".

## Design that starts in the middle
No project we undertake starts at the beginning. There's always some work that's gone before Made Tech is involved. And, of course, that's OK! Whether a client has a clear idea of
