introduction: "My second week at Hippo was an interesting mix of onboarding, internal projects and learning about Universal Credit."

Next week, I'll join the team at the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to work on an internal Universal Credit (UC) service. Here's everything I think I know about the project:

* UC was introduced in 2013 to replace six benefits and tax credits: *Child Tax Credit*, *Housing Benefit*, *Income Support*, *Jobseeker's Allowance*, *Employment and Support Allowance*, and *Working Tax Credit*.
* A claim is made online. Users follow guidance and upload supporting documents (like bank statements).
* A claim handler checks each claim and then calls the claimant to confirm their details are correct.
* This process broke down during the pandemic when [claims increased tenfold](https://dwpdigital.blog.gov.uk/2020/12/14/dwps-agile-response-to-covid-19-scaling-universal-credit-to-meet-demand/).
* Although the online application service coped well with the increased load, the end-to-end service couldn't handle a large volume of claims. This meant checking calls didn't happen in many cases and levels of fraud and error increased.
* I'll be working with a team who's job it is to reduce the volume of fraud and error in UC.

## A little knowledge is (maybe) a dangerous thing {.h3}
Even though it might be a [load of old rubbish](https://skepchick.org/2020/10/the-dunning-kruger-effect-misunderstood-misrepresented-overused-and-non-existent/), I'm a fan of the [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect). It's a reminder to stay humble; that things that appear simple often aren't on closer inspection.

I wonder how much of my understanding of the problems with UC will turn out to be wrong.

## Meanwhile, back at Hippo
I've been working with Rich and Zoe on planning a session for our user experience and service designers in Leeds in a couple of weeks. I won't give anything away, but it should be fun. 

On Tuesday, I received an unexpected gift: A box full of Hippo-branded goodies. It's a small gesture but it made a big impact in making me feel welcomed. My daughter snaffled the chocolate within 60 seconds of me opening the box.
